# GKRulesForBusiness
Use Apple iOS 9+ GameKit GKRules for Business Logic Rules :D

Requires Swift 2.2. (Not compatible with Swift 3 yet.)

This repo is a little proof of concept of implementing a business rules engine without using any 'if' statements. :D

(The one 'if let' in the JSON parser doesn't count.)
